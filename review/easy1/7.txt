Question 7

What is the default thing that Ruby will print to the screen if you call to_s on an object? Where could you go to find out if you want to be sure?

#Answer:

The default thing (if you haven't created a custom #to_s method for your class) is a representation of the class that looks like this:

#<ClassName .... @instance_variable1=value of instance_variable1, @instance_variable2=value of instance_variable2>

You could go create a custom class in IRB and check it out to be sure.
