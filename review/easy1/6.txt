Question 6

What could we add to the class below to access the instance variable @volume?

```ruby
class Cube
  def initialize(volume)
    @volume = volume
  end
end
```

#Answer:
We could add a getter method:

```ruby
class Cube
  ...
  def volume
    @volume
  end
end
```

or more simply, an attr_reader:

```ruby
class Cube
  attr_reader :volume

  ...
end
```
