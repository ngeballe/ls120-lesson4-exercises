Question 10

If we have the class below, what would you need to call to create a new instance of this class.

```ruby
class Bag
  def initialize(color, material)
    @color = color
    @material = material
  end
end
```

#Answer:
You would need to call Bag.new(some_color, some_material), passing it the parameters for color and material.
