Question 9

If we have a class such as the one below:

```ruby
class Cat
  @@cats_count = 0

  def initialize(type)
    @type = type
    @age  = 0
    @@cats_count += 1
  end

  def self.cats_count
    @@cats_count
  end
end
```

In the name of the cats_count method we have used self. What does self refer to in this context?

#Answer:

Here, the scope of "self" is the class, so it refers to the class "Cat." Putting "self" before "cats_count" makes it a class method rather than an instance method.
