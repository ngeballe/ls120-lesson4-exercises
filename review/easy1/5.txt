Question 5

Which of these two classes has an instance variable and how do you know?

```ruby
class Fruit
  def initialize(name)
    name = name
  end
end

class Pizza
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end
```

#Answer:
The class Pizza has an instance variable, @name. You know because an instance variable must start with the "@" character.
