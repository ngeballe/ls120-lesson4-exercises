Question 2

If we have a Car class and a Truck class and we want to be able to go_fast, how can we add the ability for them to go_fast using the module Speed? How can you check if your Car or Truck can now go fast?

```ruby
module Speed
  def go_fast
    puts "I am a #{self.class} and going super fast!"
  end
end

class Car
  def go_slow
    puts "I am safe and driving slow."
  end
end

class Truck
  def go_very_slow
    puts "I am a heavy truck and like going very slow."
  end
end
```

#Answer:
You can add ```include Speed``` to the Car and the Truck class, like this:

```ruby
class Car
  include Speed
  ...
end

class Truck
  include Speed
  ...
end
```

You can check that they can go_fast by creating an instance of each class and then calling ```go_fast``` on it:

```ruby
my_car = Car.new
my_car.go_fast

my_truck = Truck.new
my_truck.go_fast
```
