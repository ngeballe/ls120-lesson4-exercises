Question 7

How could you change the method name below so that the method name is more clear and less repetitive.

```ruby

class Light
  attr_accessor :brightness, :color

  def initialize(brightness, color)
    @brightness = brightness
    @color = color
  end

  def self.light_information
    "I want to turn on the light with a brightness level of super high and a colour of green"
  end

end

```

#Answer:
I'd change it to just self.information; using the word "light" again is repetitive.

```ruby

class Light
  ...

  def self.information
    "I want to turn on the light with a brightness level of super high and a colour of green"
  end
end
