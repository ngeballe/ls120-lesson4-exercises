Question 4

The designers of the vehicle management system now want to make an adjustment for how the range of vehicles is calculated. For the seaborne vehicles, due to prevailing ocean currents, they want to add an additional 10km of range even if the vehicle is out of fuel.

Alter the code related to vehicles so that the range for autos and motorcycles is still calculated as before, but for catamarans and motorboats, the range method will return an additional 10km.

#Answer:

In the Seacraft class, add a range_method that adds 10 to the result calculated in the module's range method:



```ruby

# rest of code omitted

class Seacraft
  # other code omitted

  def range
    super + 10
  end
end

# code omitted

```
