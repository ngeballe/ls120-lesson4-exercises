Question 7

If we have a class such as the one below:

```ruby
class Cat
  @@cats_count = 0

  def initialize(type)
    @type = type
    @age  = 0
    @@cats_count += 1
  end

  def self.cats_count
    @@cats_count
  end
end
```

Explain what the @@cats_count variable does and how it works. What code would you need to write to test your theory?

#Answer:
The @@cats_count variable is keeping track of how many Cat objects have been created. It is set at 0 when the class is created, then it's increased by 1 every time a new Cat instance is initialized. You can test thing theory by creating a few cat instances and then calling Cat::cats_count. It should return the number of cats you have created.
