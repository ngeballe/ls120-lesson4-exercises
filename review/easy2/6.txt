Question 6

If I have the following class:

```ruby
class Television
  def self.manufacturer
    # method logic
  end

  def model
    # method logic
  end
end
```

Which one of these is a class method (if any) and how do you know? How would you call a class method?

#Answer:
The first, Television::manufacturer, is a class method. You know because it starts with "self", which refers to the class itself since it's right inside the class, not inside an instance method. Television#model is an instance method because it doesn't start with "self" or the class name. You call a class method like this:

```
Television.manufacturer
```
