Question 5

There are a number of variables listed below. What are the different types and how do you know which is which?

excited_dog = "excited dog"
@excited_dog = "excited dog"
@@excited_dog = "excited dog"

#Answer:
The first, excited_dog, is a local variable; you can tell because it doesn't start with an "@." "@excited_dog" is an instance variable; it starts with one "@." "@@excited_dog" starts with two @'s, so it's a class variable.
