Question 1

You are given the following code:

```ruby
class Oracle
  def predict_the_future
    "You will " + choices.sample
  end

  def choices
    ["eat a nice lunch", "take a nap soon", "stay at work late"]
  end
end
```

What is the result of calling

```ruby
oracle = Oracle.new
oracle.predict_the_future
```

#Answer:
The result is that the oracle will predict your future by randomly choosing a string from the array returned by Oracle#choices: ["eat a nice lunch", "take a nap soon", "stay at work late"]. Oracle#predict_the_future will return one of the following, selected at random:

"You will eat a nice lunch"
"You will take a nap soon"
"You will stay at work late"
