Question 9

If we have this class:

```ruby
class Game
  def play
    "Start the game!"
  end
end

class Bingo < Game
  def rules_of_play
    #rules of play
  end
end
```

What would happen if we added a play method to the Bingo class, keeping in mind that there is already a method of this name in the Game class that the Bingo class inherits from.

#Answer:
The new method would be called when you call #play on a Bingo object, instead of Game#play.
