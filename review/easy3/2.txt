Question 2

In the last question we had the following classes:

```ruby
class Greeting
  def greet(message)
    puts message
  end
end

class Hello < Greeting
  def hi
    greet("Hello")
  end
end

class Goodbye < Greeting
  def bye
    greet("Goodbye")
  end
end
```

If we call Hello.hi we get an error message. How would you fix this?

#Answer:
You could fix this by creating a class method Hello.hi:

```ruby
class Hello < Greeting
  ...

  def self.hi
    greet("Hello")
  end
end
```

CORRECTION BASED ON SOLUTION 2:
You have to create a Greeting instance first, then call Greeting#greet on that, because Greeting#greet is an instance method, not a class method:

```ruby
class Hello < Greeting
  ...

  def self.hi
    greeting = Greeting.new
    greeting.greet("Hello")
  end
end
```

Or you could create a Hello object and then call the isntance method Hello#hi on that object:

```ruby

hello = Hello.new
hello.hi

```
