Question 7

What is used in this class but doesn't add any value?

```ruby

class Light
  attr_accessor :brightness, :color

  def initialize(brightness, color)
    @brightness = brightness
    @color = color
  end

  def self.information
    return "I want to turn on the light with a brightness level of super high and a color of green"
  end
end

```

#Answer:
The getter and setter methods for @brightness and @color are not adding any value; they're not being called anywhere. In fact, those instance variables themselves are being set but not called.
#CORRECTION:
The attr_accessors do add value because we could call the getter and setter methods from outside the class. The word "return" in the method Light::information is not adding any value. Just using an implicit return would be better.
