Question 6

If we have a class such as the one below:

```ruby

class Cat
  attr_accessor :type, :age

  def initialize(type)
    @type = type
    @age  = 0
  end

  def make_one_year_older
    self.age += 1
  end
end

```

In the make_one_year_older method we have used self. What is another way we could write this method so we don't have to use the self prefix?

#Answer [CORRECTED]:

We could use the instance variable @age instead.

```ruby

class Cat
  ...

  def make_one_year_older
    @age += 1
  end
end
```
