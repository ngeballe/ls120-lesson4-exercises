Question 3

When objects are created they are a separate realization of a particular class.

Given the class below, how do we create two different instances of this class, both with separate names and ages?

```ruby
class AngryCat
  def initialize(age, name)
    @age  = age
    @name = name
  end

  def age
    puts @age
  end

  def name
    puts @name
  end

  def hiss
    puts "Hisssss!!!"
  end
end
```

#Answer:
Initialize two objects:
```ruby

hugo = AngryCat.new(4, 'Hugo')
marian = AngryCat.new(3, 'Marian')

```
