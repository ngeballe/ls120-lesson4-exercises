Question 5

If I have the following class:

```ruby

class Television
  def self.manufacturer
    # method logic
  end

  def model
    # method logic
  end
end

```

What would happen if I called the methods like shown below?

```ruby

tv = Television.new
tv.manufacturer
tv.model

Television.manufacturer
Television.model

```

#Answer:
Calling tv.manufacturer will produce a No-Method Error because the class Television does not have an instance method named "manufacturer".
Calling tv.model will work because there is a Television#model instance method.
Calling Television.manufacturer will call the Television::manufacturer class method. Calling Television.model will raise a No-Method Error because there is no class method named model in the Television class.
