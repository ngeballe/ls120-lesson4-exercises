Question 1

Which of the following are objects in Ruby? If they are objects, how can you find out what class they belong to?

    true
    "hello"
    [1, 2, 3, "happy days"]

Answer: They're all objects. You can find out what class each one belongs to by calling the "class" method on it (e.g., true.class => TrueClass)
