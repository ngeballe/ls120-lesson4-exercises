Question 7

What is the default thing that Ruby will print to the screen if you call to_s on an object? Where could you go to find out if you want to be sure?

Answer:
It will print the class name.

Official Answer:
By default if you call to_s you will be telling Ruby to print the objectâ€™s class and an encoding of the object id to the console.

If you weren't sure of this answer you could of course refer to Launch School's Object Oriented Programming book, but you could also refer directly to the Ruby documentation, in this case, here: http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Object.html#method-i-to_s.
