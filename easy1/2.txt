Question 2

If we have a Car class and a Truck class and we want to be able to go_fast, how can we add the ability for them to go_fast using the module Speed? How can you check if your Car or Truck can now go fast?

module Speed
  def go_fast
    puts "I am a #{self.class} and going super fast!"
  end
end

class Car
  def go_slow
    puts "I am safe and driving slow."
  end
end

class Truck
  def go_very_slow
    puts "I am a heavy truck and like going very slow."
  end
end

Answer:
You can add the ability for them to go fast by mixing in the Speed module to the Car and the Truck class, like so:

class Car
  include Speed

  ...
end

You can check that the Car and Truck can now go fast by creating an instance variable of each class and then calling the "go_fast" method on it:

car = Car.new
car.go_fast

truck = Truck.new
truck.go_fast
