Question 3

How do you find where Ruby will look for a method when that method is called? How can you find an object's ancestors?

module Taste
  def flavor(flavor)
    puts "#{flavor}"
  end
end

class Orange
  include Taste
end

class HotSauce
  include Taste
end

What is the lookup chain for Orange and HotSauce?


Answer: Ruby will first look in the class itself, then in the mixed-in module Taste, then up the chain of ancestors, e.g. [Orange, Taste, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]. You can find the ancestor chain by calling the ancestors method on the class--e.g., Orange.ancestors.
