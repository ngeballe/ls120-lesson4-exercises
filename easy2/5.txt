Question 5

There are a number of variables listed below. What are the different types and how do you know which is which?

excited_dog = "excited dog"
@excited_dog = "excited dog"
@@excited_dog = "excited dog"

Answer:

excited_dog is a local variable because it doesn't start with any "@" characters. @excited_dog starts with one "@" character, so it's an instance variable. @@excited_dog starts with two, so it's a class variable.
