Question 9

If we have this class:

class Game
  def play
    "Start the game!"
  end
end

class Bingo < Game
  def rules_of_play
    #rules of play
  end
end

What would happen if we added a play method to the Bingo class, keeping in mind that there is already a method of this name in the Game class that the Bingo class inherits from.

Answer:
This would make a Bingo instance use the new Bingo#play method rather than Game#play.
