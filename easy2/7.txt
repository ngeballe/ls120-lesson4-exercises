Question 7

If we have a class such as the one below:

class Cat
  @@cats_count = 0

  def initialize(type)
    @type = type
    @age  = 0
    @@cats_count += 1
  end

  def self.cats_count
    @@cats_count
  end
end

Explain what the @@cats_count variable does and how it works. What code would you need to write to test your theory?

Answer:

The @@cats_count variable keeps track of the number of cats. Every time you create a new instance of the class Cat, @@cats_count is incremented. You can test this theory by calling Cat.cats_count, then creating a cat, then calling it again:

p Cat.cats_count # should be 0
Cat.new("feral")
p Cat.cats_count # should be 1
