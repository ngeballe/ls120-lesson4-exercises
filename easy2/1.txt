Question 1

You are given the following code:

class Oracle
  def predict_the_future
    "You will " + choices.sample
  end

  def choices
    ["eat a nice lunch", "take a nap soon", "stay at work late"]
  end
end

What is the result of calling

oracle = Oracle.new
oracle.predict_the_future


Answer:
The object "oracle" generates a string that starts with "You will " and ends with a randomly select choice from the menu of choices under the Oracle#choices method. But nothing is printed because there is no puts method.
