Question 6

If I have the following class:

class Television
  def self.manufacturer
    # method logic
  end

  def model
    # method logic
  end
end

Which one of these is a class method (if any) and how do you know? How would you call a class method?


Answer:
"manufacturer" is a class method; you know because its definition starts with "self," which refers to the class. You call the class method by writing <class name>.<method name>--e.g., Television.manufacturer.
