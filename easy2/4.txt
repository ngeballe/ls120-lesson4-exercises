Question 4

What could you add to this class to simplify it and remove two methods from the class definition while still maintaining the same functionality?

class BeesWax
  def initialize(type)
    @type = type
  end

  def type
    @type
  end

  def type=(t)
    @type = t
  end

  def describe_type
    puts "I am a #{@type} of Bees Wax"
  end
end

Answer: You could delete the methods "type" and "type=" and write  "attr_accessor :type" instead:

class BeesWax
  attr_accessor :type

  def initialize
  ...
end
