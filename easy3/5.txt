Question 5

If I have the following class:

class Television
  def self.manufacturer
    # method logic
  end

  def model
    # method logic
  end
end

What would happen if I called the methods like shown below?

tv = Television.new
tv.manufacturer
tv.model

Television.manufacturer
Television.model

Answer:
tv.manufacturer would produce a NoMethodError because Television::manufacturer is a class method, not an instance method. Television.model would produce a NoMethodError because Television#model is an instance method, not a class method.
