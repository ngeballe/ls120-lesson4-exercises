Question 3

When objects are created they are a separate realization of a particular class.

Given the class below, how do we create two different instances of this class, both with separate names and ages?

class AngryCat
  def initialize(age, name)
    @age  = age
    @name = name
  end

  def age
    puts @age
  end

  def name
    puts @name
  end

  def hiss
    puts "Hisssss!!!"
  end
end

Answer:
mushroom = AngryCat.new(4, "Mushroom")
zoi = AngryCat.new(5, "Zoi")
