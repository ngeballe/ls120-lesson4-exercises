Question 2

In the last question we had the following classes:

class Greeting
  def greet(message)
    puts message
  end
end

class Hello < Greeting
  def hi
    greet("Hello")
  end
end

class Goodbye < Greeting
  def bye
    greet("Goodbye")
  end
end

If we call Hello.hi we get an error message. How would you fix this?

Answer:
You could fix this by creating an instance of the Hello class, and then calling the "hi" method on that:

hello = Hello.new
hello.hi

Or you could add a class method Hello::hi:

class Hello < Greeting
  def hi
    greet("Hello")
  end

  def self.hi
    greet("Hello")
  end
end

CORRECTION:

class Hello < Greeting
  def hi
    greet("Hello")
  end

  def self.hi
    greeting = Greeting.new
    greeting.greet("Hello")
  end
end
