Question 7

What is used in this class but doesn't add any value?

class Light
  attr_accessor :brightness, :color

  def initialize(brightness, color)
    @brightness = brightness
    @color = color
  end

  def self.information
    return "I want to turn on the light with a brightness level of super high and a color of green"
  end

end


Answer:
You're not using the instance variables @brightness and @color or the getter and setter methods (Light#brightness, Light#color, Light#brightness=, Light#color=). The return in Light::information is unecessary; you could just use an implicit return.
