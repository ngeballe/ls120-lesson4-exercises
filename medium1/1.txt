Question 1

Ben asked Alyssa to code review the following code:

class BankAccount
  attr_reader :balance

  def initialize(starting_balance)
    @balance = starting_balance
  end

  def positive_balance?
    balance >= 0
  end
end

Alyssa glanced over the code quickly and said - "It looks fine, except that you forgot to put the @ before balance when you refer to the balance instance variable in the body of the positive_balance? method."

"Not so fast", Ben replied. "What I'm doing here is valid - I'm not missing an @!"

Who is right, Ben or Alyssa, and why?

Answer:
Ben is right. The word balance in the "positive_balance?" method doens't need an @ because it is invoking the getter method BankAccount#balance that was created by the line "attr_reader :balance".

CORRECTION: The "balance" method will return the instance variable "@balance".
