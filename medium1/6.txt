Question 6

If we have these two methods:

class Computer
  attr_accessor :template

  def create_template
    @template = "template 14231"
  end

  def show_template
    template
  end
end

and

class Computer
  attr_accessor :template

  def create_template
    self.template = "template 14231"
  end

  def show_template
    self.template
  end
end

What is the difference in the way the code works?

Answer:
There's no functional difference. The first version sets the template using the instance variable @template directly, while the second uses the setter method Computer#template. In the first version, Computer#show_template includes the word "self" when using the getter method Computer#template. But these differences in style don't have any real-world effect.
