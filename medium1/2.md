Question 2

Alyssa created the following code to keep track of items for a shopping cart application she's writing:

```ruby
class InvoiceEntry
  attr_reader :quantity, :product_name

  def initialize(product_name, number_purchased)
    @quantity = number_purchased
    @product_name = product_name
  end

  def update_quantity(updated_count)
    # prevent negative quantities from being set
    quantity = updated_count if updated_count >= 0
  end
end
```

Alan looked at the code and spotted a mistake. "This will fail when update_quantity is called", he says.

Can you spot the mistake and how to address it?

Answer:
The mistake is using "quantity = " in the line "quantity = updated_count if updated_count >= 0". This creates a local variable called "quantity", but what you want to update the instance variable quantity. The way to fix this is to change the line to:

```ruby
    @quantity = updated_count if updated_count >= 0
```

Or you could add a setter method quantity= and use "self.quantity":

```ruby
class InvoiceEntry
  attr_reader :product_name
  attr_accessor :quantity

  def initialize(product_name, number_purchased)
    @quantity = number_purchased
    @product_name = product_name
  end

  def update_quantity(updated_count)
    # prevent negative quantities from being set
    self.quantity = updated_count if updated_count >= 0
  end  
end
```
